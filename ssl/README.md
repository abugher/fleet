Run generate to generate SSL material.  Specify all short names for a host, starting with the most canonical, and both the short name and the short name combined with a fixed domain will be provisioned.  At least one short name must be specified.  This will generate a certificate, certificate chain, and certificate revocation list.

If 'dmz' is specified as a short name, the root domain name will be added as a valid name for the host, in addition to the subdomain 'dmz'.

If no host key is present, one will be generated, and all dependent files will be regenerated.  (The script may have a somewhat overzealous notion of "dependent" at the moment.)  If CA material is missing, or there is no CA material, the CA material will be regenerated, and all dependent material will be regenerated, but other hosts will not be automatically regenerated.

Run generate with no arguments to only generate CA material.  (It may be desirable to also regenerate host signing requests and certificates...)

There should be a script named revoke which takes one short hostname as an argument, which must be the first shortname specified when the target certificate was generated.  This certificate will be revoked, and the CRL will be updated.  The CRL can then be pushed to the web via ansible.  The location of the CRL is specified in the cert, so any client using it should have opportunity to discover it has been revoked.
